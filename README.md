# Project Title: Digital Clock using STM32F103C8 and ST7735S Display

## Overview:
This project, developed for the IEEE ASUSB Embedded Systems Committee, is a digital clock system built using an STM32F103C8 microcontroller interfaced with a TFT ST7735S 1.8-inch display. The clock functionality relies on the Real-Time Clock (RTC) peripheral of the STM32F103C8 microcontroller to accurately maintain and display the current time.

## Features:
1. **Real-Time Clock (RTC) Integration:**
    - Utilizes the RTC peripheral of the STM32F103C8 microcontroller for accurate timekeeping.
    - Enables setting and updating the current time and date.

2. **Display Interface:**
    - Interfaced with the ST7735S 1.8-inch TFT display for visual representation of the time.
    - Displays the current time in digital format with clear visibility.


## Requirements:
- STM32F103C8 microcontroller board.
- ST7735S 1.8-inch TFT display.
- STM32CubeIDE or similar development environment for STM32 microcontrollers.

## Usage:
1. Connect the STM32F103C8 board to the ST7735S display according to the pinout configurations.
2. Power on the system and observe the digital clock display on the TFT screen.
